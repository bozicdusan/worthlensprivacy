  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 15, 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how WorthLens (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and shares
    personal information when you use the WorthLens mobile application (“App”).
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Authentication Data:</strong>
      We use Firebase Authentication (including third-party sign-in providers) to identify users.
      This may include your name, email address, and profile photo.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Subscription Information:</strong>
      Subscriptions and payments are processed through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.
      We do not collect or store credit card or payment details.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Photos and Camera Access:</strong>
      When you upload or take photos of items, those images are used to generate resale value estimates.
      Images are stored for up to <strong>14 days</strong> and are then automatically deleted.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Usage Data:</strong>
      We collect limited usage data (such as feature interactions and app performance metrics)
      to improve the App’s functionality and reliability.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Authenticate and manage user accounts</li>
    <li>Provide item analysis and resale value estimates</li>
    <li>Operate and improve App features</li>
    <li>Manage subscriptions and access to paid features</li>
    <li>Ensure security and prevent misuse</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal data. We may share your data with trusted third-party services such as
    Firebase for authentication, and Google Play or Apple App Store for subscription management.
    Please refer to
    <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

    </a>
    for more details.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also use OpenAI’s API to analyze images and generate valuation-related insights.
    If you enable AI-powered features, inputs and outputs (including images and text) may be shared
    with OpenAI to provide and improve their services. OpenAI may temporarily store this data for
    safety and research purposes. You can learn more by reviewing

    necessary to provide the App or comply with legal obligations.
  </p>
